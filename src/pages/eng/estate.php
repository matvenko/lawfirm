            <h2 class="sub-h2" style="margin-top: 12px;"> ABOUT GEORGIA </h2>

            <p>
                The country of Georgia, or as we say in Georgian, “Sakartvelo”,
                is known for its wine, cuisine, natural beauty, safety, hospitable people, and, most importantly,
                the favorable investment opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Georgia is situated in the Caucasus region of Eurasia.
                Georgia is an electric mix of cultures with a strong national identity,
                which creates the perfect environment for anything from vacation to expatriation.
                The Georgian language is one of the world’s fourteen unique languages,
                and Georgia was the first place in human history to produce wine.
                As we say here in Tbilisi, “Europe starts here”.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-h2" style="margin-top: 12px;"> SAFETY </h2>

            <p>
                Georgia is a rapidly developing country with very low levels of crime and corruption.
                According to the Numbero report (2016), Georgia is the safest country in Europe, and the sixth safest country in the world.
            </p>
